# Transportation PhD Recruitment Pipelines

This repository contains data and analysis code for a study of PhD recruitment patterns in transportation-focused civil engineering programs in the United States.

The project examines advisor–student linkages, undergraduate origin patterns, and institutional pipelines within top U.S. civil engineering departments, with a focus on transportation research groups.


## Data Description

The dataset links transportation-focused civil engineering faculty to their PhD students using publicly available information collected in late 2025. All personally identifying information has been removed.

Advisor–student relationships are constructed using a roster-based structure: **for each student, the advisor is defined as the closest preceding faculty member listed above the student within the same institution and research group**. This reflects how research group rosters and lab webpages typically present faculty and their students.

Key variables include:
- Institution
- Role (Advisor or Student)
- Faculty rank or student year
- Undergraduate institution country
- PhD institution country
- Department

Only advisors with a primary appointment in civil engineering and a transportation research focus are included.

## Analysis

The Jupyter notebook reproduces all analyses reported in the accompanying paper, including:
- Descriptive statistics of advisors and students
- Country-level recruitment patterns
- Advisor-level heterogeneity
- Permutation-based homophily tests
- Sensitivity analyses under alternative null constructions

The notebook is designed to be run end-to-end.

## Reproducibility

All results in the associated paper can be reproduced using the anonymized dataset and analysis notebook in this repository. No proprietary or confidential data are used.
